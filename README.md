# list_view

Application tested on a Pixel 3 XL API 30 emulator

The goal of this project was to make an application with scrolling lists. 
Horizontal lists were based on a similar genre and vertical ones were other genres available.
Each card can be clicked anywhere and show a bigger image. This bigger image can also be clicked and opens up the IMDb.
The cards can also be long clicked for more options including additional information, Wikipedia, and IMDb.


There is a little login simbol next to "Movie App" but it was meant for checking if emails were valid (not actually existing).
